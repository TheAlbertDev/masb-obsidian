Welcome to the [MASB‚Äôs Obsidian Vault](https://github.com/TheAlbertDev/masb-obsidian). This repository is intended to be browsed using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a free note-taking application available for Windows, MacOS, Linux, Android and iOS. Once installed, you can clone and browse the contents of the repository.

Following are the steps to follow to clone the repository and open the Obsidian vault from the application.

## Clone the repository

2. Open a Git bash in the workspace. In Windows, right click the new folder and select ‚ÄúGit bash here‚Äù.
